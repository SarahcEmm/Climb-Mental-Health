User Experience
I wanted the website to be none triggering and give information to members of the public who may have limited knowledge of mental health issues.
I wanted to make it clear and concise. I chose the colours of teal and light sea green as these have generally been associated with a calming effect
and I did not want users to be startled or evoke negative emotions. 
I called my charity "Climb" because mental health can often feel a bit like a bit of a climb. When your mental health is good, it is like walking on the flat, but when mental health issues take hold it can feel like you are climbing a steep mountain.
I have tried to make the website as intuative as I can, It is not busy, and I have tried to take away the sigma of mental health by concentrating on the positives as well as the negatives. I have included a "get help" button in case people need urgent help for a mental health problem. 

Anyone accessing my website should be able to navigate easily and whilst it is simple I think it gives good, basic information about the issues around mental health and wellbeing. I have included a poster that people can use in their workplaces or community areas for free thus helping to stop the spread of disinformation about mental health problems.
This poster I produced myself so that I do not fall under any copyright infringements involved in the distribution of the poster.

There are links to outside organisations to get extra information theses are :

plus a "Need help now?" that links to https://www.mind.org.uk/need-urgent-help/ which is located on the MInd website. this is because it is important to provide professional help when dealing with medical emergencies.

I wish to make my wesite attrative to visitors so they will be return users. 
The information I have on my support page I hope will be used to access information and will be a go to for memebers of the public to use the strategies I have put on there. 

The layout of the website covers the entire width of the website I wanted all the elements to seamlessly run into each other but be seperated by colour, without it becoming to busy. 

I designed my website with the help of balsamiq and although I changed a few things I stayed pretty close to the outline i CONSTRUCTED

As you can see the images match up very well with the finished website.

BUGS
I struggled with my submit button on the footer and could not get it to move o the correct position. I am oping that I will have time to go back and fix this bug, however I wish to debug it afterwards as although it isn't working as much as i would have liked it is functional.
