USER EXPERIENCE 

I wanted the website to be none triggering and give information to members of the public who may have limited knowledge of mental health issues.
I wanted to make it clear and concise. I chose the colours of teal and light sea green as these have generally been associated with a calming effect and I did not want users to be startled or evoke negative emotions. 
I called my charity "Climb" because mental health can often feel like a bit of a climb. When your mental health is good, it is like walking on the flat, but when mental health issues take hold it can feel like you are climbing a steep mountain.
I have tried to make the website as intuative as I can, It is not busy, and I have attempted to take away the sigma of mental health by concentrating on the positives as well as the negatives. I have included a "get help" button in case people need urgent help for a mental health problem. This requires expert help, and as such will link to an external website with professional advice.

Anyone accessing my website should be able to navigate easily and whilst it is simple I think it gives good, basic information about the issues around mental health and wellbeing. I have included a poster that people can use in their workplaces or community areas for free thus helping to stop the spread of disinformation about mental health problems.
This poster I produced myself so that I do not fall under any copyright infringements involved in the distribution of the poster.

There are links to outside organisations to get extra information theses are :
. Mind.org.uk
. Rethink.org
plus a "Need help now?" that links to https://www.mind.org.uk/need-urgent-help/ which is located on the Mind website. This is because it is important to provide professional help when dealing with medical emergencies.

I wish to make my wesite attrative to visitors so they will be return users. 
The information I have on my support page I hope will be used to access information and will be a go to for memebers of the public to use the strategies I have put on there. 

The layout of the website covers the entire width of the website I wanted all the elements to seamlessly run into each other but be seperated by colour, without it becoming to busy. 

I designed my website with the help of balsamiq and although I changed a few things I stayed pretty close to the outline I constructed.

As you can see the images match up very well with the finished website.

BUGS
I struggled with my submit button on the footer and could not get it to move to the correct position. I would probably fix this better later. It functions but it doesn't look quite right. 

The page was shifting to the right and part of the content was not showing, I remedied this by changing the rem value in the header css.

No other bugs were reported.

VERIFICATION

The HTML and CSS are fully tested and function correctly. I had a few minor issues, mainly with one of my files containing spaces, but this was remedied by changing the file name. 

FEATURES

I wanted the website to have some basic features and not rely on just images and text. Whilst there are images and quite a bit of text, I was aiming at breaking this information up with interactive elements to give the use a rest. For example, on my support page there is a section of text and then a youtube video. This give the reader a chance to rest their eyes and enjoy some additional information that is not in text form. 
I used a video from Nottingham City Council and verified that the information included in the media was correct.
I also placed links on the support page for external professional resources to get additional information.
I used illustrations from the same artist in the majority of my images, this helped to tie in all the elements and gave my website a consistant theme. I decided to donate to the illustrator for her work, as this is something I may have to do in future projects. I wish to continue to see high quality work being available for free, however it is tough out there and I wanted to credit the content creator fully. 
I used Pixabay for my images specifically using the art of https://pixabay.com/users/lavnatalia-5858294/ 

WHAT I WISH I HAD DONE AND HOW I CAN IMPROVE ON FUTURE PROJECTS

I wish I had maybe added a third colour or at least maybe changed the opacity of the two colors I already had. I will definetly look at the design element for future projects, however with this one I felt the two colour approach still worked well and gave me a good contrast without being too garish or mawkish.
I was also aware that the images I used were mainly or women and I would have probably included more diversity in my project.
