            <h2>What is Mental Health First Aid?</h2>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training is a program designed to equip individuals with the skills to identify, understand, and respond to mental health issues and crises. Similar to physical first aid, MHFA prepares people to offer initial support until professional help is available. The training covers a wide range of mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and crises such as suicidal thoughts or panic attacks. Participants learn how to approach, listen, and communicate non-judgmentally with someone experiencing these challenges.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>The training also focuses on educating people about the importance of reducing stigma and promoting early intervention. By raising awareness and understanding, MHFA aims to foster a supportive environment where mental health issues can be addressed without shame or fear. It helps individuals to recognize early warning signs, such as changes in behavior, mood, or speech, and provides guidance on how to connect those in need with professional resources.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>MHFA is valuable for people in all walks of life, including educators, first responders, community leaders, and even friends and family members. It empowers individuals to feel confident in helping someone facing a mental health challenge, creating a community of care that can ultimately improve overall well-being. This training is a key step toward addressing the growing need for mental health support in society.</p>

            <p><em>"Mental Health First Aid gave me the confidence to approach someone in crisis. Knowing how to listen without judgment and guide them to the right resources made a real difference."</em></p>
            <br>    
            <p><em>"The training taught me that small actions, like starting a conversation, can have a big impact. It’s not about having all the answers, but being there when someone needs support."</em></p>
            <br>    
            <p><em>"I now feel equipped to not only recognize mental health issues but also respond in a helpful and supportive way, without fear of making things worse."</em></p>
            <br>
            <p><em>"The course helped break down the stigma I had about mental illness and showed me that anyone can experience a mental health challenge—knowing how to help is a skill we all need."</em></p>
